OOP - A method of organizing and structuring code that is based on the idea of "objects" is known as object-oriented programming (OOP). 
Data and the logic to alter that data are both included in self-contained units called objects. 
In OOP, real-world entities are frequently represented by objects, and the actions and behaviors of those entities are represented by the code included within each object. 
OOP seeks to increase the reusability, and maintainability of code, which can be very useful when working on extensive, intricate projects.
